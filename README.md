**Description**

Hello, if you've used the google keyboard on your android smartphone, you probably noticed a tab with text emoji like "‰∏î_(„Éª_„Éª )" 
or something like that. The ability to send such emoji is provided only on the phone, i made this program to fix this, 
using hot keys you can quickly input prepared emotions or phrases.

***

**Installation**

`git clone https://github.com/Hearty0/textemojis`

then open textemojis.py

`python textemojis.py`

Congratulations! Now you can use the program

***

**Configuration**

if u wan't to change the main hotkey (default is 'ctrl + shift ')

textemojis.py and change 6 line

`mainkey = ('key + key ')` or `mainkey = ('key ')`

**!!!**there must be a space at the end, as in the examples**!!!**

***

**New emoji**

each emoji is stored in an array in an file emojis.py

for new emoji you must uncomment emoji template

`e10 = ["key", "emoji", "description"]` or something.

then

in `"key"` write your key for new emoji, but before that, see if the key is busy by another emoji

in `"emoji"` write your new emoji, for example („ÄÄ-_ÔΩ•) Ô∏ª„Éá‚ïê‰∏Ä ‚ñ∏

in `"desctiption"` write short deskription, for example, sniper

***

that's all, i hope my program will help you.
have a nice day!
